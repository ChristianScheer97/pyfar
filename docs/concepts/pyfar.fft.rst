Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
-----------------------------------------------

The sections below give background information that is helpful to
understand how the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the corresponding
normalizations are defined in pyfar and how these are related to the
concepts of energy and power signals as well as their handling in
arithmetic operations.
