Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/pyfar/pyfar/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pyfar could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official pyfar docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/pyfar/pyfar/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `pyfar` for local development.

1. Fork the `pyfar` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyfar/pyfar.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv pyfar
    $ cd pyfar/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 pyfar tests
    $ python setup.py test or py.test
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5 and 3.6. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/pyfar/pyfar/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.


Testing Guidelines
-----------------------
**Test-Driven-Development (TDD)** is the fundamental technique we agreed up on in developing the pyfar software packages to ensure a good software development practice. In principle, it is based of three steps [https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html]
* Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
* Write the functional code until the test passes.
* Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.

In the following, here are some more specific guidelines. Note: these are not generally applicable outside of pyfar.
* The main tool used for testing is `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html>`_
* All tests are located in the *tests/* folder.
* Avoid dependencies on other pyfar functionalities except for the functionality you want to add. This allows easier debugging in case of failing tests due to errornous implementations. A recommended workflow is given in the following sections.

Fixtures
~~~~~~~~
* "Software test fixtures initialize test functions. They provide a fixed baseline so that tests execute reliably and produce consistent, repeatable, results. Initialization may setup services, state, or other operating environments. These are accessed by test functions through arguments; for each fixture used by a test function there is typically a parameter (named after the fixture) in the test functionâ€™s definition." (from https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html)
* Define the variables used in the test only once, either in the test itself or, preferably, implement a fixture for that.
* Fixtures are generally implemented in conftest.py. Thus, they are made automatically available to all tests. Only, if you are 100% sure the fixture you are implementing is of no use in other files, consider to implement it in the file itself.

Stubs
~~~~~
* In case of pyfar, **state verification** is applied in the tests. This means that the outcome of a function is compared to a desired value (``assert ...``). For more information, it is refered to the section *The Difference Between Mocks and Stubs* at https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html.
* To follow the principle of avoiding the dependency on other functionalities in case of objects, **stubs** are used. Stubs are objects, which appear like the objects they are replacing, but with reduced functionality and *fixed, well defined properties*.
* It requires a little more effort to implement stubs of the pyfar classes. Therefore, stub utilities are provided in *pyfar/testing/stub_utils.py* and imported in ``confest.py``, where the actual stubs are implemented.
    * Note: the stub utilities are not meant to be imported to test scripts directly
    * The implemention of stub utilities simplifies and harmonizes the testing within the package as the improve the readibility and as they are tested separately.
    * The implemention as a private submodule further allows the use of similar stubs in other, related packages with pyfar dependency (i.e. pyfar subpackages like haiopy, spharpy ...).
A good example of the recommended stub workflow is the ``sine()`` fixure in ``conftest.py``.
**Extended Use of Stubs**
* Beside this classical use of stubs, it is furthermore recommended to use the stubs as dummy objects, for example as data needed to call a certain function. A good example is the function ``test_signal_init`` in ``test_signal.py``.
**When Not to Use Stubs**
* Sometimes, the dependency on another pyfar functionality is desired. Nevertheless, it probably makes sense to use a fixture for that. A good example is the ``sine_signal()`` fixure in ``conftest.py``.
* External depencies do not need to be mocked. Failing tests due to changes in external packages are accepted.
* In rare cases, actual mocks are needed. Primarily in the context of hardware communication. Example:


Other Remarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Consider to use more sophisticated pytest functionalities, for example
    * Patches
    * Loops

Tips
~~~~

To run a subset of tests:

$ py.test tests.test_pyfar


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bumpversion patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
